REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Escape (\") any double-quotes in the key-value content. The JSON object must match the following structure (no additional text, explanations, or markdown):

{
  "name": "Character's \"full\" name",
  "description": "A detailed description of the character's appearance, personality, and background (2-4 sentences)",
  "stats": {
    "str": 10,
    "dex": 12,
    "con": 14,
    "int": 8,
    "wis": 13,
    "cha": 16
  },

  "alignment": "Character's moral alignment",
  "personality": "Key personality traits and quirks",

NOTES:
- Stats should be realistic D&D 5e ability scores (3-18, with 10-11 being average)
- Equipment should fit the character's role and the location's context
- Personality should include both positive traits and interesting flaws
- All fields are required unless the context doesn't support them (use null for missing fields)
